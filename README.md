Facebook Messenger Echobot

This is a bot that receives messages from Facebook Messenger and parrots them back. This project was made to practice creating a python server, as well as to gain experience with Heroku and Facebook's developer tools. I followed this tutorial by Kostis Tsaprailis to complete the project.

TODO
- build on this project to create bot that returns a jumble of the message sent to it.
