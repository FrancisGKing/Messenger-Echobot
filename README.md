Facebook Messenger Echobot

This is a bot that receives messages from Facebook Messenger and parrots them back. This project was made to practice creating a python server, as well as to gain experience with Heroku and Facebook's developer tools. I followed [this tutorial by Kostis Tsaprailis](https://tsaprailis.com/2016/06/02/How-to-build-and-deploy-a-Facebook-Messenger-bot-with-Python-and-Flask-a-tutorial/) to complete the project.

TODO
- build on this project to create bot that returns a jumble of the message sent to it.
